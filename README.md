Project of Probabilistic algorithms and games. 

The goal is to solve the problem of k-servers which can be described as follows:
- k mobile technicians (servers), {s1, s2, . . . , sk}, provide maintenance service to n customers,
- the technicians treat requests emanating from the customersâ€™ sites; these requests arrive in series of length
N , (r1, r2, . . . , rN ),
- a request must be processed immediately (it is impossible to put it on hold)
